This project is built based on the Canvas component in Java. It incorporates mechanics such as bullet and object collision, animated health and ammo bars, rotating elements, and moveable character ships and aliens. All objects present on the screen were drawn using coordinates that represent points in the game window and refreshed every 10th of a second. Movement keys are A and D (Left and Right) and Space Bar to shoot.

To run the game, locate Asteroid -> src -> game -> GalacticDefenseProject.java and run it in your specific IDE.

Developed as a group project for the CMSC-132 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) II Class.
